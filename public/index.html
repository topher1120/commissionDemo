            <h2>Welcome to the Commissioning Demo</h2>
            <p>This demo walks you through a typical commissioning process for a set of smart energy devices.
                While this demo is not using live devices, Magpie has experience building similar functionality
                for devices in this industry. Make sure to try this demo on mobile devices as well.
